# Logical regression analysis of the IODS project 

*This section describes the steps taken to perform logical regression analysis of data obtained for the Machine Learning repository*

First, let me begin by reading the data for this analysis into R from online. 

```{r}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
#library(ggplot2)

# Reading the data from web address
data <- "https://github.com/rsund/IODS-project/raw/master/data/alc.csv"

# read the math class questionaire data into memory
math_por <- read.table(data, sep = "," , header=TRUE)

# We can have glimpse of the data
str(math_por)
dim(math_por)

colnames(math_por)
```
